# Blackjack
A non-gambling take on the classic card game. The objective is to win 5 Hands before the dealer. Winning a hand is getting the closest to '21' without going over.
Each numbered card is worth the number it is given. Face cards are worth 10. The Ace is worth your choice of 1 or 11. Going over 21 causes the hand to end and the offender loses the hand. You choose to hit/hold after your second card each hand. The dealer must hit until they have 17+.

## Potential Issues
* Ace value 1/11
⋅⋅⋅* Possibly take choice out of it and make it contextual
⋅⋅⋅* Possible to also give a button to decide value, change state of 'ace object'
* Shuffling. When and how often? How many decks?
⋅⋅⋅* Use enough decks to not have to shuffle midgame.
* More than one player?
* Animations
* Figuring out the landing pages
* Using a mac
